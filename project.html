                            <br><br>
                            In this project, you will create a personal portfolio website to showcase your skills, projects, and achievements. This portfolio will serve as an online resume and a platform to highlight your work to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. The project will cover various web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly backend development if you choose to add more advanced features.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Objectives:</b>
                            <br><br>
                            The project involves designing a clean and professional layout with sections such as Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, Resume, and Contact. Use a consistent color scheme and typography to maintain a cohesive look.

On the Home Page, include a brief introduction about yourself, a professional photo, and a short tagline or motto. The About Me Page should have a detailed biography, covering your background, education, and interests, along with a section for hobbies or personal interests.

The Projects Page will showcase your previous projects with descriptions, technologies used, and images or screenshots. Include links to live projects and their GitHub repositories. On the Skills Page, list your technical skills, tools, and technologies you are proficient in, using progress bars or charts to visually represent your proficiency levels.

For the Resume Page, provide a downloadable PDF version of your resume and optionally include an interactive version on the page. The Contact Page should have a contact form for visitors to reach out to you and links to your social media profiles like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter.

Create a responsive navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes and implement smooth scrolling for a better user experience. Ensure the website is mobile-friendly and looks good on various devices and screen sizes by using CSS media queries and a responsive grid system.

For optional advanced features, you can implement a blog section where you can post articles or updates, add a dark mode toggle for user preference, and use a backend server to handle form submissions and send emails.
<br><br>
<b>Tools and Technologies:</b>
<br><br>
For the frontend, use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a CSS framework like Bootstrap. If you choose to include backend features, you can use Node.js, Express, PHP, or any other backend technology you are comfortable with. Use Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration, and optionally, design tools like Figma or Adobe XD for designing the layout.
<br><br>
<b>Expected Outcomes:</b>
<br><br>
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional and visually appealing personal portfolio website. This website will not only help you in job applications and networking but also provide you with hands-on experience in web development, from design to deployment.
<br><br>
<b>Learning Outcomes:</b>
<br><br>
Through this project, you will understand the basics of web design and user experience (UX), learn to structure a website using HTML, style your website using CSS, and make it interactive with JavaScript. You will implement responsive design techniques to ensure your site looks good on all devices and optionally gain experience with backend development and form handling. Using version control will help you manage your project efficiently. This project will be a great addition to your portfolio and a strong foundation for your future web development endeavors.
